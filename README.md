# Introduction

Hi, I'm Karatus.
I'm interested in hacking, especially pwn, reverse engineering... and the Linux Kernel.

Nowadays, I'm trying to understand the kernel's basic principle and make somthing with C lang and Rust lang.


# Proceeding Projects

- [Making a RTOS by reading a book](https://github.com/TwoPair/os-clone)
- Linux module programming by reading a book


# What's the next of your study?

There is no clear way for me to choose specific subjects that are related to Linux, C, Rust, or smth.
What I am sure of now is, however, that I should start from the scratch.

So, the next plans I have are...

- Analysis of the start of the kernel
- Tracking mentors I have in mind (persistently, continuously)
